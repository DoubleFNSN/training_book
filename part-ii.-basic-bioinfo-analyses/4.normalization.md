# 4.Normalization

talk about a better way of differential expression

## Problems and issues

* Sparsity of data and technical noise \("batch effects"\) --&gt; will mask the signal of interest

**Causes:**



## Spike-in for Normalization

**RNA content \(total amount and species\) varies**

![](../.gitbook/assets/rna-content.png)

**for mRNAs:**

* 92 ERCC molecules
* 8 mRNAs
* whole transcriptome HeLa RNAs

**for sRNAs:**

* 52\(?\) sRNA sequences

**Caveat:**

Typically only half of the spike-in were detected.



## Recommendation for single cell RNA-seq \(and exRNA-seq\) normalization

1. **scran: **
   1. pools multiple cells \(samples\) in order to estimate cell-specific size factors in the **presence of zero inflation** and **unbalanced differential expression** of genes across groups of cells;** **
   2. **precluster** \(using e.g. rank-based clustering\) the cells into smaller, more homogeneous sets 
2. SCnorm
3. Census

If considering spike-ins:

1. SAMstrt
2. GRM
