**Take-Home Message:**

The first three sections in PART II are very basic bioinformatics analyses, which are commonly used in various studies. **For most students, you may stop here**. It's fine if you did not finished some of the homework successfully in the last few weeks. You can practice more and improve your skills in the following months and years. We also recommend some other Tutorials/Pipelines you can learn from:

* **RNA-seq analysis** pipeline:: [https://github.com/mgonzalezporta/TeachingMaterial](https://github.com/mgonzalezporta/TeachingMaterial)
* **lncRNA analysis** pipeline: [http://webhome.weizmann.ac.il/home/igoru/PLAR/](http://webhome.weizmann.ac.il/home/igoru/PLAR/)
* **ENCODE** pipelines: [https://www.encodeproject.org/pipelines/](https://www.encodeproject.org/pipelines/)
