## Running Scripts

### Software/Tools

> **Assumption** for most normalization and differential expression analysis tools: The expression levels of most genes are similar, i.e., not differentially expressed.

a\) **DEseq**: defines **scaling factor** \(also known as **size factor**\) estimates based on a pseudoreferencesample, which is built with the geometric mean of gene counts across all cells \(samples\).

b\) **EdgeR** \([TMM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20196867)\): trimmed mean of _M_ values

![](../.gitbook/assets/m.png)

c\) **Wilcox Test using RPM**: Read counts Per Million of total mapped reads; alternatives: RPKM, TPM

> **Performance:**

### Example of single case

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Set Parameters" %}
```bash
# genome seuqneces and annotaions
ln -s /BioII/lulab_b/shared/genomes ~/genomes
export hg38=~/genomes/human_hg38/sequence/GRCh38.p12.genome.fa
export gtf=~/genomes/human_hg38/gtf

# working space
cd ~/proj_exRNA
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Homework and more

1. Identify differential expressed genes for other RNA types. between differential conditions, i.e. Normal Control \(NC\) V.S. HCC using three methods: edgeR, DESeq2 and Wilcox/Mann-Whitney-U Test.
2. Draw Venn plot to show the difference among the above three methods.
