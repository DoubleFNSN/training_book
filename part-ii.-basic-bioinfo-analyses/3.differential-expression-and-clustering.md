### **Inputs**

| **File format** | **Information contained in file** | **File description** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bam | **alignments** | Produced by mapping reads to the transcriptome. | Reads are trimmed using a proprietary version of cutAdapt. We map to transcriptome for a better sensitivity \(see details in protocol and example\). |
| tsv | **gene \(microRNA\) quantifications** | Non-normalized counts. |   |

### **Outputs**

| **File format** | **Information contained in file** | **File description** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bigWig | **signal** | Normalized RNA-seq signal | Signals are generated for transcriptome both the plus and minus strands and for unique reads and unique+multimapping reads.  |
| tsv | **gene \(ncRNA\) quantifications** | Non-normalized counts. |   |



## Running Scripts

### Software/Tools 

> **Assumption** for most normalization and differential expression analysis tools: The expression levels of most genes are similar, i.e., not differentially expressed.

a\) **DEseq**: defines **scaling factor **\(also known as **size factor**\) estimates based on a pseudoreferencesample, which is built with the geometric mean of gene counts across all cells \(samples\).

b\) **EdgeR** \([TMM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20196867)\): trimmed mean of _M_ values

![](../.gitbook/assets/m.png)



c\) **Wilcox Test using RPM**: Read counts Per Million of total mapped reads; alternatives: RPKM, TPM

> **Performance:**

### Example of single case

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Set Parameters" %}
```bash
# genome seuqneces and annotaions
ln -s /BioII/lulab_b/shared/genomes ~/genomes
export hg38=~/genomes/human_hg38/sequence/GRCh38.p12.genome.fa
export gtf=~/genomes/human_hg38/gtf

# working space
cd ~/proj_exRNA
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="a. DEseq2" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="b. EdgeR" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="c. RPM" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Homework and more

1. Visualize your mapped reads with IGV \(locally\) and/or UCSC Genome Browser \(on line\).
