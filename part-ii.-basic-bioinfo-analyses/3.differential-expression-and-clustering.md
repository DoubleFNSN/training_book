# 3.Differential Expression & Clustering

## Basic Methods of Differential Expression

**Assumption** for most normalization and differential expression analysis tools:

_The expression levels of most genes are similar, i.e., not differentially expressed._

**Recommendation for bulk RNA-seq**

* **RPM**: Read counts Per Million of total mapped reads; alternatives: RPKM, TPM
* **DEseq**: defines **scaling factor **\(also known as **size factor**\) estimates based on a pseudoreference sample, which is built with the geometric mean of gene counts across all cells \(samples\).
* [**TMM**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20196867)** **\(**EdgeR**\): trimmed mean of _M_ values
